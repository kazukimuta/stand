# Policy of release versioning

v `Majors` . `Minors` . `Patches`

### Patches

Patch releases are defined as bug, performance, and security fixes. They do not change or add any public interfaces. They do not change the expected behavior of a given interface. They are meant to correct behavior when it doesn't match the documentation, without also introducing a change that makes seamless upgrades impossible.

### Minors


Minors are the addition and refinements of APIs or subsystems. They do not change APIs or introduce backwards compatible breaking changes. These are mostly completely additive releases.

### Majors

Majors contain changes in behavior that could potentially break code that worked in prior releases.
